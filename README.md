# Low-Cost Modular 3D Tracheostomy Training Model
A cost-effective, reusable, and anatomically accurate 3D training model for tracheostomy procedures, developed as part of the Design Practicum, IIT Mandi (Nov 2024).
This project addresses the high cost and limited accessibility of conventional surgical training models by introducing a cassette-based modular system built with layered rubber sheets and 3D-printed anatomical parts.

Key Features
Cost-Effective Training
Reusable, modular cassettes with replaceable layers.
Reduces training costs by over 30%, making practice more accessible.
Realistic Simulation
Integrated rolling mechanism to simulate varying skin tension across patient profiles.
Provides surgeons-in-training with a lifelike experience.
Anatomical Accuracy
Replicates critical anatomical structures: larynx, thyroid gland, tracheal rings.
Improves surgical precision and decision-making.
Clinical Validation
Developed in collaboration with medical professionals.
Ensures both anatomical fidelity and practical usability.
Project Goals
Increase accessibility to affordable surgical training tools.
Provide a realistic, safe, and modular platform for medical education.
Encourage open-source innovation for low-cost healthcare solutions.
